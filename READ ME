This repository contains an end-to-end Sales Data Analysis project where I cleaned, transformed, and visualized sales data using AI-powered cleaning, Excel, and Power BI.
The goal of this project is to uncover key business insights such as revenue trends, product performance, regional sales patterns, and customer behavior.

🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the complete analytics pipeline:

✔ Raw data exploration

✔ AI-assisted data cleaning & preprocessing

✔ Excel-based corrections & transformations

✔ Power BI dashboard development

✔ KPI extraction & business insights

The final dashboard provides a clear and interactive view of sales performance that supports quick decision-making.

🔍 1. Dataset Description

The dataset includes:

Product details

Sales date

Region / Country

Quantity sold

Sales amount / Revenue

Customer data

The raw data contained inconsistencies such as:

Missing values

Duplicates

Incorrect formats

Irregular date structures

Inconsistent text (categories, names)

🤖 2. AI-Assisted Data Cleaning (Important)

A major highlight of this project is the use of AI tools (ChatGPT/Copilot) to speed up the cleaning process.

AI helped with:

🧹 Detecting and fixing missing values

🔁 Identifying duplicates

🧽 Reformatting dates and numbers

🔍 Spotting outliers

🔤 Standardizing product/category names

🔧 Suggesting formulas for Excel

⚙️ Recommending best transformations

📄 Creating clean, analysis-ready tables

This drastically reduced manual time and made cleaning fast, accurate, and effortless.

➡️ AI was used both for cleaning logic and Excel formula assistance.

🧮 3. Excel Data Preparation

After AI suggestions, I used Microsoft Excel for:

Applying recommended formulas

Creating calculated fields

Removing duplicates

Cleaning text values

Standardizing date and currency formats

Creating intermediate sheets for BI import

Excel served as the main transformation layer before loading data into Power BI.

📈 4. Power BI Dashboard

The cleaned dataset was imported into Power BI, where I designed an interactive dashboard featuring:

Key Visuals

Total Sales & Revenue

Monthly & Yearly Trends

Top Products & Categories

Profit vs Revenue comparison

Regional Sales Distribution

Customer Segmentation

KPI Cards for quick insights

Dashboard Features

Slicers for filtering by region, product, or year

Interactive charts

Clean, professional layout

AI-guided improvements to visual design & DAX formulas

🎯 5. Insights Gained

Some example insights (replace with your real insights):

🔼 Revenue is highest in Q3
